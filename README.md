# GTASOL-CoreHacks-69.9.9
GTA State of Liberty Project (Beyond VC)

Main source is in the 7z file.

This projects aim is to upgrade the RW Vice City engine to dx9.

I also need to get the source code and hacks stable.

Edit;

Just relized i uploaded the source files complecely wrong, should be listed here instead, not a 7z archive.

I will fix this in time.
