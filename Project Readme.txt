    Quick Introduction:

Stage 1 (early versions before version 69.x)
		GTA State of Liberty is a collection of cities from GTAIII, VC and SA. Bringing all the
        GTA islands onto one stable map that has been every GTA players dream.

        This version of the project will soon show models from other GTA games in an infused version of   
        the map where I hope to blend all the new islands together in a sympathetic way.

Stage 2 (Moving ahead with remodeling the maps, versions beyond 69.x)
        I would like to hope that the methods used to build the maps would have been done in the
        style that R might have created them.

		What has changed and why this release?

        The Map is the same. only the file organization has changed to speed up loading and in game object
        rendering, car and ped spawning. New object.dat definitions added for objects that can be knocked
        over or destroyed.

        As many may know I had lost a lot of material due to a HD crash, I have managed to remodel most of
        what was lost and this will be added in the next release and the beginnings of the support for steam.

    3) So why am I releasing this?

        We release beta releases every so often to give the community access to the mod thus this allows
        other members to contribute towards this project.

        Anyone can be a beta tester and join in the great hunt for bugs and mapping issues, Please post
        these issues in the thread below. http://www.gtaforums...p?showforum=265

        If you have an interested in learning how to mod then this is the     place to be.
     
     
    4) Installation:

        Installing beta 69.9 (StrongAsBull)

        Providing you installed your copy of Vice City from CD or from Steam you need to run Vice City at
        least once settings you desired screen and display settings.

        Following this example of how to install the mod might be easier then how it is written in the mods
        documentation. (Readme)
    There are 2 ways to install the mod:

        The first would be to install Vice City as a Clean copy on your Hard drive and make sure all the files
        was not set as read-only as this would create issues over writing the files later.

        Start the GTA ViceCity.exe and check your settings for the display etc. and quit GTA Vice City.

        Copy the mods folder over your installed GTA Vice City replacing all the files.

        You should be good to go so just run the Client - Loader.exe     instead of the gta-vc.exe
     
        The Second way that works best for Linux users:

        Unpack all the mod files into an empty folder called GTASOL69.9.

        Drag the Anims, Icons, Mp3, Mss, Movie, Skins, Text, Txd (but keeping LOADSC0.TXD) folders from 
        your installed VC install into your GTASOL69.9 folder, also the files from your Vice City root folder like
        the Mss32.dll, gta-vc.exe and readme files.

        Copy the Audio folder from Your Vice City Play Disk (Disk 2) into the GTASOL69.9 folder.
     
        Run the mod from the Client - Loader.exe.
     
    5) Recruiting:

    8) History of the Project:
     
    Quote

    Quote

        GTA: State Of Liberty (SOL) is a mod that combines maps from all of the GTA Randerware era that was released on the PC - GTAIII, GTA VC and GTA SA, Ie - (Liberty City, Vice City, Los Santos, San Fierro, Las Venturas, as well as all rural areas of San Andreas)

     
    Things have changed since GTA SOL Beta 69.5 where I've wanted to bring a new level of creativity to the project where the maps may well be changed for a 6th and final time. The new aim is to remodel all 3 maps LC. VC and SA with all the LCs, VCs and beta changes from later released GTA Stories games. These models added to the map in a way to merge in and not replace existing models.
     
    I want to have a new take. A new vision of the old maps where I hope to bring something new for the next release.
     
    2004/5: The Start:

    We added to Midway Island, Mainland Liberty (to be Chicago), Miss Liberty (created by ODIE), bridges and tunnels linking the islands to each other. We are in the process of writing a new launcher in order to replace the gta-vc.exe.

    GTA State of Liberty has always been about pushing the bounds of what the Vice City Engine can do but in time we hope to move to other game engines. My/ Our aim is to remodel most of the cities to improve overall game play and add the changes from the PS2 story editions.

    midway2a.th.jpgmidway1a.th.jpgmidway1j.th.jpgcountrye.th.jpg

     
     
    9) Development:

    2004: The Start.
    I conceived the idea of combining the maps GTA Liberty City and GTA Vice City together on one single map. however this idea of combining maps was not new around the modding community as the GTAWO team had attempted this before me and on a smaller scale.

    So initially we moved all the coordinates of Vice City to the west and the positioned Liberty City to the East. As a result this map idea turn out to be Map Version 1. There have been 4 other map layouts in SOL to how you see the map today and this is Map Version 5.

    2006: Copy Cats abound:
    A lot of other mods with almost the same name had come and passed like GTA LVS, GTA Unity (Russian team). I decided to add SA 4 months after the game was released by Rockstar. I had decided to re-brand the project from GTASA-LVC with the merge with GTA: Ultra to GTA: State Of Liberty. At the end of 2009 we released Version 51.9. After that the development stalled for some time.

    2010: The Merge with VCO:
    we merged with Vice City Online multiplayer and GTA: State Of Liberty Online was conceived from VCO, SOL-O was for a time developed in secret. Early 2012 VC0 decided to spin away from SOL leaving us with a new beginning.

    2013: Heading in 2 directions - 2 versions of the game map (Original and SOL version)
    We will be redoing / remodeling the island chain 'VC. LC and SA' so I can take the models 'We have made' to a better game engine. This will be a side project from the goings on without the SOL project.

    There will also be a native VC. LC and SA untouched version with the original models that R have created. This version will have none of the SOL add ons like bridges or other land masses. We are doing this version because there are fans of the mod who want to fly to each island where the current version of the mod beta 69.9+ is designed more around driving around the map.
     
     
    10) Joining the Team:
     
    An Open Door policy will be in place where members can come and join in without the commitment to being on a team. I will offer leadership like in any project or in time someone else can take leadership from me so the project can continue on.

    How to join the team. Well, anyone can and you do not even have to ask as this is a community project. All you have to do is type either on this thread that you are in and what you would like to do or add me to your Skype -ID X-Seti and say !optmein

    All you need to do is download the mod and start posting in this section on the board and of course in the correct thread. Bugs, Glitches. Tell us about these issues and even better that you're able to fix them.
     
     
    11) A new future for the Project:
     
    SOL Online will be GTA State Of Liberty once again, leaving Vice City Online to go their own way.

    Where did we go wrong? Well I could rant on a while and it depends on your point of view I suppose. There have been many issues within the team and outside in our personal lives that built up - after all life, like other bodily functions, happens. Me with my illness, family, and death of my father last November. Regex with his personal and work life. Unfortunately that reduced the amount of time we had to put towards the project.

    Where do we go from here? Well: GTASOL will become a community project for GTAForums and only GTAForums. The modding files would be open for everyone else to use in there own projects ie.:

        All Coding - Exe hacks, Game soft hacks.
        All Mapping - Models and Texture.
        All Animation -Vehicles and Peds.

    All I ask is please give credit where credit is due. Add a credit note to your mods read me file.

    An Open Door policy will be in place where people can come and join in without commitment to being on a team. I will offer leadership like in any project or in time someone else can take leadership from me so the project can continue on. All I ask is you have at least one mod of your own before you join and you do not have to ask to be on the team, just join this thread and start posting.

    Please remember that the project files and everything else within GTA: State Of Liberty will become propriety of GTAForums except content owned by Rockstar Games and Take 2. If I was asked to give a time line I will try to stick to it in terms of what engine that will be worked on.

    The time line is open to debate so what I plan may well change. Like I said, life happens, but I will do my best.

        2012: 1 more year for the Vice City engine but the development does not have to end there.
        2013: I would hope to be ready for Rage or Better.
        2015: Who knows, but what ever we are doing the future looks bright.

    That is enough for me to do. Now in order for me to bring this project to it's realization, I need your support in the following:

    Helping me find the right people who might be interested in spending some time on the mod. Wanting to model and map in order to improve what we have already. Help with the EXE Launcher so I can move on to mapping.

    If you have anything else to offer, bring it here.
